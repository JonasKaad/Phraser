# Phraser

Phraser is a mobile app developed for the course CSED404 - Mobile & Ubiquitous Computing.

It is designed to help users quickly access and save translated phrases in various languages based on customizable categories. The app's main functionality includes displaying, translating, and organizing phrases into folders for quick retrieval. Additionally, the app will have context-aware assistant, which provides relevant phrases based on factors such as time of day or location.

## Features

- **Customizable Categories**: Users can create and organize phrases into their own categories, each displayed as a navigable folder.
- **Phrase Translation**: New phrases entered by the user are instantly translated into a target language.
- **Phonetic Support**: Along with translations, phonetic representations are provided to assist with pronunciation.
- **Audio Playback**: Translated phrases can be played aloud to help with pronunciation and language learning.
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: The app suggests phrases based on context (e.g., time of day), which users can add to their own categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Uses SwiftUIâ€™s `LazyVGrid` for efficient and clean category display, alongside a streamlined phrase entry and display interface.
